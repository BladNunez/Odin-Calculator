# Odin-Calculator

Personal project to work on the basics of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In this project I will create a GUI calculator by first creating all the elements a calculator contains such as buttons and a space where numbers will populate when a button number is pressed. Style will be added with CSS to make the GUI presentable and clean. JavaScript is the last step for event handling and Manipulation of the DOM.

This project certaintly helped solidify my basic CSS skills and my DOM manipulation skills in JavaScript.
